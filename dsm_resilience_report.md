# Impervious Landcover in Dar es Salaam Floodplains

## Question and Overview

This analysis is designed to assess how land cover in flood prone areas may impact urban resilience to climate change in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. We quantified the amount of impervious land cover relative to the flood prone area of each ward of the city by using building footprints and road centerlines as a proxy for impervious surfaces. We found significant variation in the amount of impervious land cover in floodplains across different wards, with densely populated, coastal areas towards the center of the city having much more heavily developed floodplains. However, since our question was so simple and we encountered significant difficulties performing the analysis, we do not feel that these findings carry much weight.

## Data

The data for this analysis is drawn from [Open Street Map](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) and [Resilience Academy](https://resilienceacademy.ac.tz/), a Tanzania-based project that aims to provide reliable, publicly accessible data and analysis to mitigate the impacts of climate change in developing cities. Both the Open Street Map and Resilience Academy data were created in collaboration with [Ramani Huria](https://ramanihuria.org/en/about-us/), a community mapping project based in Dar es Salaam.

Flood prone areas are derived from [Dar es Salaam Flood Scenario](https://geonode.resilienceacademy.ac.tz/maps/352) (**this link isn't quite what we want but the real one seems to be down) data created by Resilience Academy. This layer was created by analyzing a detailed elevation model of the city, and is not based on historic flood events.

Building footprints and road centerlines were drawn from Open Street Map and prepared by [Joseph Holler](https://github.com/josephholler) using [OSM2PGSQL](https://osm2pgsql.org/). Over the past several years the Ramani Huria project has trained local university student and community members to digitize and tag map features, so the OSM data for Dar es Salaam is much more reliable than it is in many other developing cities. More details about the Ramani Huria project's training and mapping methods can be found [here](https://ramanihuria.org/en/mapping/).
